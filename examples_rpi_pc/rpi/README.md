We advice to use the latest Raspberry Pi Os version (formerly raspian). Other distributions might not work as well with the automated scripts, but this is not rocket science. Have look at the setup bash scripts for hints.

In order to use the examples for rPi, it is adviced to follow the guide in the parent folder.
